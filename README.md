This project is about creating a tool to compare two sequences, such as DNA, proteins, or even words, to find the best way to match them together. 
Think of it like solving a puzzle where we align two strings to maximize their similarity while accounting for gaps or mismatches.
For example, if we have two sequences like "WHAT" and "WHY," the goal is to align them neatly to see their similarities and differences. This tool uses a step-by-step process:
Building the Foundation: We create a "scoreboard" to evaluate how well different parts of the sequences match or differ.
Making Decisions: At each step, we choose whether to match letters, add a gap, or introduce a mismatch, depending on what gives the best score.
Finding the Best Path: After filling out the scoreboard, we trace back the steps to reveal the best alignment between the sequences.
For instance, aligning "GCATGCT" and "GATTACA" might give results like this:
GCATGCT  
G-ATTACA  
By the end of this project, you'll have created a working program to automate this process, complete with clear outputs and even visualizations to show how the algorithm works behind the scenes. 
This tool is widely used in biology, text comparison, and other fields where sequence alignment matters.
